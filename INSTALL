INSTALLATION
============

Installing this war requires the following components:
- Glassfish 4
- JDK 7
- MariaDB
- MariaDB JConnect jdbc driver in glassfish ($GLASSFISH/glassfish/lib)
- JQuery (automatically connects to a CDN, so no worries there)
- Fancybox (Lightbox replacement for jquery, I'm using an old version,
  version jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.zip. To be on the safe side, I included it
  into git.)

Steps
-----

0. install MariaDB
1. start MariaDB ("systemctl start mysqld")
2. create a database (using, for example, mysql-workbench executing 
    "create database YourPersonalPhotographOrganiser")
3. create a user with appropriate rights in the new database
4. install Glassfish 4
5. Put in an administration password, it asks for one.
6. Install MariaDB Client Library for Java Applications (JDBC driver)
    You can do this by copying the JDBC jar file into glassfish/domain1/lib
    (requires glassfish restart)  
7. Start Glassfish glassfish-4.0/bin/asadmin start-domain domain1
8. Go to http://localhost:4848 en log in with user admin/password you just supplied
9. Setup the jdbc connection pool to the database created.
    For instance with the following settings:
    Poolname: YourPersonalPhotographOrganiser
    Resource type: javax.sql.DataSource (local transactions, which are fine)
    Database Driver Vendor: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
    Select Next.
    Datasource Classname: org.mariadb.jdbc.MySQLDataSource

    portNumber: 3306
    databaseName: YourPersonalPhotographOrganiser
    serverName: localhost
    user: photographer
    user: photographer
10. Setup the jdbc resource, the war assumes it is called "jdbc/YourPersonalPhotographOrganiser".
    For instance with the following settings:
    JNDI Name: jdbc/YourPersonalPhotographOrganiser (this is the same name as in the persistence.xml)
    Select the poolname of the pool you created in the previous step.
11. deploy the war to glassfish
12. deploy the fancybox stuff to ~GlassFish_Server/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot (assuming defaults here)
13. Check the logs

Logging
-------

Add the following entries to glassfish3/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/logging.properties:

gallery.images.ImageOperations.level=FINEST
gallery.servlets.FileOperations.level=FINEST
gallery.servlets.ImageServlet.level=FINEST
gallery.beans.PhotographBean.level=FINEST
gallery.database.entities.Photograph.level=FINEST

Addendum
--------

Don't forget to properly specify the data source in glassfish.

The software is looking for a JDBC Resource named 
YourPersonalPhotographOrganiser.
