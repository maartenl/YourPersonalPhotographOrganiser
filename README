An attempt from me at creating a Photo gallery.

WHY
---

Given the fact that there are numerous other photo galleries, why should
you use this one?

1. it's very easy to comprehend and very simple
2. it uses the JDK 7 and JEE 3.1 (under Glassfish), if you wish to learn these two, here's
your chance
3. it has almost everything you need for home use, I do not recommend it for
website use.

Requirements

1. simple database, easy to make changes directly, if so required
2. used for home use
3. no authentication or authorization required
4. helps me to understand the jdk 7, glassfish and jee 3.1, by using
all the new stuff in there.
5. absolutely NO changing of the photographs, all changes are done
in java, in memory, in glassfish. *)
6. flexible in where these photographs are located (no need to keep them in
the webdir, for example)


*) I've had too many instances where:
1. changing files from webinterface is a security risk, and requires proper
access rights.
2. changing files causes the extra data present in the jpegs put there by
photocameras to be discarded
3. changing files potentially causes deterioration of the quality of the
jpegs
4. changing files has sometimes caused the file to be damaged in some way
5. changing files makes it impossible to determine if the photo is already 
present in your collection

Some of the new stuff that is being used here:
JDK7 (Look for "JDK7" in the sourcecode)
1. multiple catch
2. try-with-resources
3. diamond-notation
4. filevisitor interface
5. Path class usage
JEE 3.1
1. no local interfaces on beans
2. EJBs inside the WAR, no longer is an EAR required
