$.ajaxSetup({ cache: false }); => tis said that this causes jquery to skip
caching for ALL ajax calls.

Adding the following as "data" to be sent to the server in an ajax call in 
jquery, for example $.get causes it to add _=456789 to the url, defeating
caching (if you need to).
            { "_": $.now() }, // defeat caching

- Add the following to the persistence.xml to enable logging of SQL statements.

      <property name="eclipselink.logging.logger" value="ServerLogger"/>
      <property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="FINE"/>
